# Face Img/Video based drowsiness recognition

This repository is dedicated to “AUTOMOTIVE” Project. This was a collaboration with Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence (VCMI) Research Group of | INESC Technology and Science | Porto. The project was further develop and used/tested on Bosch´s system.

## Goal
Development of robust real-time Drowsiness detector system to detect driver fatigue:
 - Explore impact of facial dynamic fusion information (landmarks and eyes/mouth images)
 - Compare the use of DBN with traditional ML classifier (SVM, KNN, DecisionTree)

## Approach
Development ML\DL models for detecting drowsiness recognition based on facial image/video. 

## Scripts/Files
- pp_presentation (pdf/slides that summarize the internship results and were used to support the oral presentation)
- python_notebook (python implementation: preprocessing, frames visualization, Training loop and testing)
